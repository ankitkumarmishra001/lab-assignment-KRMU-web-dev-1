# Web Dev Lab 3 – Responsive Portfolio Website

This is my Lab 3 assignment for Web Development – I.  
The task was to create a one-page responsive personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS.  
I have used Flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries, animations, and hover effects as mentioned in the problem statement.

## 📌 Features of My Website

### ✔ Responsive Design  
The website works on laptop, tablet, and mobile screens.  
I used media queries to adjust layout on smaller screens.

### ✔ Flexbox  
Flexbox is used mainly in:
- Header section (logo and navigation)
- Hero section (text and image alignment)

### ✔ CSS Grid  
Grid is used in:
- Skills section  
- Projects section  

Each card is arranged in rows/columns using auto-fit.

### ✔ Animations  
I added:
- Fade-in animation on hero heading  
- Color-changing animation on "Full Stack Developer"  
- Hover effects on buttons and cards  

### ✔ Relative Units  
I used rem, %, vh/vw for widths, padding, and font sizes.
